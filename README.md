# Azure Blueprint multi-tier web application solution for FedRAMP

This Azure Blueprint solution automatically deploys a multi-tier web application architecture with pre-configured security controls to help customers achieve compliance with FedRAMP requirements. The solution consists of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and PowerShell scripts that guide resource deployment and configuration. An accompanying Blueprint [compliance documentation](https://github.com/AppliedIS/azure-blueprint/wiki) is provided, showing security control inheritance from Azure and where deployed resources and configurations align with NIST SP 800-53 security controls, thereby enabling organizations to fast-track compliance obligations.

#### Quickstart
1. Clone repository
2. Run azure-blueprint/predeploy/Orchestration_InitialSetup.ps1. [Read more about pre-deployment.](#pre-deployment-script)
	- This script will ask you to login to Azure Gov and supply a new admin username/password for user and sql accounts.
	- This script will create a resource group with a keyvault -- remember the names that you choose for these items because you will need them in the next step. The script will also output a GUID that you can use in the next step.
3. Click the button below, log in to Azure Portal Gov, fill out the parameters, and click "Purchase".

## Architecture

This solution deploys a notional architecture for a web application with a database backend. The architecture includes a web tier, data tier, Active Directory infrastructure, application gateway and load balancer. Virtual machines deployed to the web and data tiers are configured in an availability set and SQL Servers are configured in an Always On availability group for high availability. A management jumpbox (bastion host) provides a secure connection for administrators to access deployed resources.

## Instructions

This Azure Blueprint solution is made up of a combination of JSON configuration files and PowerShell scripts that are handled by Azure Resource Manager's API service to deploy network resources within Azure Government Cloud. For more information about template deployment read the following links:

1. [Azure Resource Manager Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#template-deployment)
2. [ARM Template Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions)
3. [ARM Templating and Nesting Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-linked-templates)

### PRE-DEPLOYMENT

During pre-deployment you will confirm that your Azure subscription and local workstation are prepared to deploy the solution. The final pre-deployment step will run a PowerShell script that verifies setup requirements, gathers parameters and credentials, and creates resources in Azure to prepare for deployment.

#### Azure subscription requirements

This Azure Blueprint solution is designed to deploy to Azure Government regions. The solution does not currently support Azure commercial regions. Customers must have a paid Azure Government subscription or sponsored account to deploy this solution.

#### Local workstation requirements

PowerShell is used to initiate pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment tasks. PowerShell version **[5.0]** or greater must be installed on your local workstation. In PowerShell, you can use the following command to check the version:

`$PSVerstionTable.psversion`

The PowerShell pre-deployment task includes installation of Azure PowerShell modules, so PowerShell must be run in administrator mode.

#### Pre-deployment script

The pre-deployment PowerShell script will verify that a supported version of PowerShell is installed, that the necessary Azure PowerShell modules are installed. Azure PowerShell modules provide cmdlets for managing Azure resources. After all setup requirements are verified, the script will prompt for parameters and credentials to use when the solution is deployed. The script will prompt for the following parameters in order:
* **azureUsername**: Username for Azure (ex. someuser@orggov.onmicrosoft.com)
* **azurePassword**: Password for Azure account above
* **adminUsername**: Username you want to use for adminstrative accounts for resulting deployment
* **adminPassword**: Administrator password for local VM accounts (must complexity requirements)
* **sqlServerServiceAccountPassword**: SQL service account password (must complexity requirements)
* **subscriptionID**: To find your Azure Government subscription ID, navigate to https://portal.azure.us and sign in. Expand the service menu, and begin typing "subscription" in the filter box. Click on **Subscriptions** to open the subscriptions blade. Note the subscription ID, which has the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.
* **resourceGroupName**: The resource group name must be a string of 1-90 alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z), periods, underscores, hyphens, and parenthesis and cannot end in a period (e.g., `blueprint-rg`).
* **keyVaultName**: The Key Vault name must be a string 3-24 alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and hyphens and must be unique across Azure Government.
* **aadAppName**: Name for a new Azure Active Directory application that will be created
* **keyEncryptionKeyName**: Name for a new key used in SQL Server Encryption

#### Pre-deployment instructions

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local workstation
`git clone https://github.com/AppliedIS/azure-blueprint.git`
2. Start PowerShell as an administrator
3. Run Orchestration_InitialSetup.ps1
4. Enter the parameters above when prompted

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DEPLOYMENT

During this phase, an Azure Resource Manger (ARM) template will deploy Azure resources to your subscription and perform configuration activities.

After clicking the Deploy to Azure Gov button, the Azure portal will open and prompt for the following settings:

* **Key Vault Name**: Name of the Key Vault created during pre-deployment

* **Key Vault Resource Group Name**: Name of the resource group created during pre-deployment (e.g., blueprint-rg)

* **Admin Username**: User account name for local VM administrator accounts

* **Cert Data**: Cert 64bit encoded .pfx file for SSL

* **Cert Password**: Password used to create cert for SSL

* **Job Scheduler GUID**: The GUID for the runbook job to be started (use New-GUID in Powershell)

* **OMS Workspace Name**: Assign a name for the Log Analytic Workspace Name

* **OMS Automation Account Name**: Assign a name for the automation account used with OMS

#### Deployment instructions

1. Click the button below.

	[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/AzureGov.png)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAppliedIS%2Fazure-blueprint%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)
2. Enter the settings from above.
3. Review the terms and conditions and click **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**.
4. Click **Purchase**.

#### Monitoring deployment status
This solution uses multiple nested templates to deploy and configure the resources shown in the architecture diagram. The full deployment will take approximately **[120]** minutes. You can monitor the deployment from Azure Portal.

See [TIMELINE.md](/docs/TIMELINE.md) for a resource depenency outline.

### POST-DEPLOYMENT

#### Post-deployment instructions

1. Set Retention time - Set the data retention time in the OMS resource blade from 31 to 365 days to meet FedRamp compliance

#### Accessing deployed resources

You can access your machines through the MGT vm that is created from the deployment. From this VM, you can remote into and access any of the VMs in the network.

#### Cost

Deploying this solution  will create resources within your Azure subscription. You will be responsible for the costs associated with these resources, so it is important that you review the applicable pricing and legal terms associated with all resources and offerings deployed as part of this solution. For cost estimates, you can use the Azure Pricing Calculator.

#### Extending the Solution with Advanced Configuration

If you have a basic knowledge of how Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates work, you can customize the deployment by editing  azuredeploy.json or any of the templates located in the nested templates folder. Some items you might want to edit include but are not limited to :
- Network Security Group rules (nestedtemplates/virtualNetworkNSG.json)
- OMS alert rules and configuration (nestedtemplates/provisioningAutoAccOMSWorkspace)
- Application Gateway routing rules (nestedtemplates/provisioningApplicationGateway.json)

For more information about template deployment read the following links:

1. [Azure Resource Manager Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#template-deployment)
2. [ARM Template Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions)
3. [ARM Templating and Nesting Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-linked-templates)

If you do not want to specifically alter the template contents, you can edit the parameters section at the top level of the json object within azuredeploy.json.

#### Troubleshooting

If your deployment should fail, to avoid incurring costs and orphan resources it is advisable to delete the resource group associated with this solution in its entirety, fix the issue, and redeploy the solution. See the section below for instructions to delete all resources deployed by the solution.

Please feel free to open and submit a GitHub issue pertaining to the error you are experiencing.

#### How to delete deployed resources

To help with deleting protected resources, use postdeploy/deleteProtectedItems.ps1 -- this will specifically help you with removing the delete lock on the resources inside your vault.

## Known Issues

1. SQL Always On configuration is currently broken for SQL2016-WS2012R2 . [See issue #73](https://github.com/AppliedIS/azure-blueprint/issues/73)
2. Deployment only works successfully with a new key vault (it does not work with an existing key vault).
